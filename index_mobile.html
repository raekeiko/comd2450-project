		My name is Elena Barbosa, I  am a Web Design major who is interested in pursuing a personal business or UX research and design. I have been illustrating since I was 8 years old and have gained considerable design experience over the years, I can confidently say I have graphic design experience as well as coding experience but I am always excited to learn. Some skills I possess are in the Adobe suite <em>such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, XD, Premiere Pro, Animate CC, etc.</em><br><br>
	At home I like to relax, play videogames, watch animated cartoons and movies, and talk to friends. I started drawing as a hobby but I eventually came to believe that it would be a good fit for me for a career and was excited to try it out. I started in Bronx Community College then transferred to New York City College of Technology where I took graphic design classes and then declared a Web Design major, I now enhance my skills every day.
